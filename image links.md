# Images links

If you need to add an image. you could do it with this:

```
![alt text](link to image "tooltip")
```

!["This is a random image from picsum"](https://picsum.photos/200/300 'this is the tooltip')

You could also use normal html properties in order to create personalized tags.

<img src="https://picsum.photos/200/300?grayscale" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; border: 10px red solid">

You could even add a link to an image.
