# Lists

## Unordered list

In order to create an unorded list, you can use a + or a * like this:

This to do during quarantine time:

* watch all those left sereies

+ read a book

* spend time with your family

+ learn markdown

## Ordered list

In order to created an ordered list, you have to use a number followed by a dot _(It doesn't matter which number it is)_ in each one of the points. Like this:


Top colors for me

1. Blue

5. Light blue

1. Black

10101. Gray

## Nested lists

If you need to create a nested list, you have to add an indentation to make it comes true. Like this:

* Something

    * something that is above

        * something that is even more deep

            * this is the deepest I can get

    * another thing

* something else

* the last thing in this list

## Content inside a list

If you need to add content like a paragraph, image, or code to a list, you can do it this way:
