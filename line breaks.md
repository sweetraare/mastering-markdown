# Line breaks, horizontal rules & Quotes

## line break

When you want to make a new paragraph, you have to leave a line of separation between paragraphs

Just like I did here. But if you need just a line break. You can use the ```<br>``` tag. <br>
Like this. And it will be the same paragraph but with a line break.

## Horizontal rules

If you want to separate something with an horizontal rule, you have to add at least 3 dashes ```---``` or 3 equal signs ```===```

---

Just remember to leave a line of separation between your paragraph and the horizontal rule or it will be transformed to a H1 or a H2

===
