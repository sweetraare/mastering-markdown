# Links and markdowns

If you need to add a link to some site, you could make it using the entire URL like this: www.google.com

But if you are looking for a more elegant solution, you could add a link to a text like this: [Google](www.google.com)

You could also add a tooltip to the site like this: [Google](www.google.com "Here you can find anything you need")
